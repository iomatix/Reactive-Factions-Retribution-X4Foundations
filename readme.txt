Reactive Factions Retribution - X4: Foundations
Reactive Factions Retribution is an improved version of the Reactive Factions mod. Its purpose is to solve the main problems and inconveniences related to the basic version and enhance the content.

Main Features List
ðŸŒŒ Optimized Code: The Reactive Factions code is optimized for better performance.
ðŸŒŒ Extension Menu: Supported by Mod Support APIs. Almost every important variable is configurable.
ðŸŒŒ Bonus System: The more recognizable you are, the higher the bonus to relations you will receive.
ðŸŒŒ Cooldowns System: Prevents the viral effect. Every faction has its own cooldown slots, making the mod more dynamic. Recently implemented feature fixes the spiral effect with cooldowns reduced to 0, but performance may vary, so increase the value if you have any performance issues.
ðŸŒŒ Revamped Language File: Improved language file and credits value formatting.
ðŸŒŒ Increased Power Levels: The number of power levels is increased.
ðŸŒŒ Improved Immersion: Tried my best to implement the system more into the X4 universe.
ðŸŒŒ And More...
